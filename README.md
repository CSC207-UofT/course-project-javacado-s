# Welcome to Javacado's!

## Using our System
To use our catering services, run our program, log in, and follow the prompts! If you are new to Javacado's, you can 
create an account with us. With an account, you'll be able to make catering requests for events, cancel events, modify 
events, and view your event details.

To request catering for a new event, we will need the event name, location, date, number of attendees, and meal to be 
catered. Our system will let you know if we have enough employees on that day to accept the request. Once your request 
is successfully processed, you will receive event confirmation details, our menu for the event, and the total price of
catering.
