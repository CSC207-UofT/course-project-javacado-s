# Welcome to Javacado's!

## Using our System
To make a catering request, run our program, and it will prompt you to enter some information about your event.
This includes the event name, location, date, number of attendees, and meal to be catered. Our system will let
you know if we have enough employees on that day to accept the request. Once your request is successfully
processed, you will receive event confirmation details, our menu for the event, and the total price of
catering.
