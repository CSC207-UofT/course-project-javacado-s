##**SPECIFICATION**

Create a program that receives catering requests for events. Each **event** has a title, date, time, location, 
expected number of attendees, and type of food needed. Each user who makes a request has a username and
contact information (phone number or email), which will be saved in the system.

The catering system has a certain number of **employees** it can assign to events, where the number of employees 
needed for a certain event depends on the number of attendees. If there are not enough employees on the 
specified date for the event, the system will not allow the user to request catering.

It should be possible for the system to get a list of all events for a particular date, and the number of 
employees available for a particular date.

If a request is successfully submitted, the user will receive a bill for the service (amount will depend on 
number of event attendees/number of employees needed).
