##**SPECIFICATION**

Create a program that receives catering requests for events. Each **events.Event** has a name, date, location, 
number of attendees, and type of **meals.Meal** needed. Depending on the type of meal and number of attendees, the event will
need a certain number of **employees** assigned.

The **Catering System** employs a set number of **employees** who can be assigned to events. Each employee can only work at
one event per day. If there are not enough available employees on an event date, the system will not allow the user to
request catering. If a request is successfully submitted, the user will receive a confirmation message with event
details, as well as the total price of the catering. This price will depend on the meal type requested as well as the
number of event attendees.

It should be possible for the system to get a list of all events for a particular date, and the number of 
employees available to work for a particular date.
