1. open questions your group is struggling with
- 


3. what has worked well so far with your design

So far, what has worked well with our design is that we were able to successfully integrate
a user system in our program, while abiding to clean architecture principles such as the
dependency rule. Furthermore, we were able to use packaging strategies in order to organize 
our code. We were also able to add complexity to use cases such as EventManager, as well we 
were able to extend entities such as Employee class. All of these steps followed the principles 
of clean architecture. 



We have provided a summary of what each group member worked on: 

- Rose: Implemented User class, command classes 
- Lucas: Modified EventManager
- Faith: Implemented Employee subclasses, populated employee file 
- Zhengdong: Added Meal types, user rating system 
- Karen: Implemented command classes, packaging 
- Maggie: Implemented Progress status in Event, event override equals method 
- Zi Xuan: Implemented UserManager 
- All: testing, progress report, design document  

Here is a summary of what each group member is planning on working on next:
