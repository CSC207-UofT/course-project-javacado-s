# Progress Report

1. Open questions your group is struggling with
- 


2. What has worked well so far with your design

So far, what has worked well with our design is that we were able to successfully integrate
a user/login system in our program, while abiding to clean architecture principles, such as the
dependency rule, as well as maintaining a clear hierarchy in our classes. This hierarchy was 
maintained as we followed the single responsibility principle (each class only has 
one responsibility), the dependency rule, and the open/closed principle. Furthermore, we were able to use packaging 
strategies in order to organize our code. We were also able to add complexity to use cases such as EventManager, as 
well we were able to extend entities such as Employee class, which helped extend the functionality and scope of the 
program. Another design that worked well as our decision to serialize Event objects, as this allowed for our program 
to have an account system for its users. 


We have provided a summary of what each group member worked on: 

- Rose: Implemented User class, command classes, design document + specification  
- Lucas: Modified EventManager, event tests, exceptions package 
- Faith: Implemented Employee subclasses, employee file, progress report 
- Zhengdong: Added Meal types, user rating system 
- Karen: Implemented command classes, Command interface, packaging, style warnings
- Maggie: Implemented Progress status in Event, event override equals method 
- Zi Xuan: Implemented UserManager, fixing EmployeeManager
- All: testing, progress report

Here is a summary of what each group member is planning on working on next:
